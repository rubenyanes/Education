## Online Courses

The following list is created based in my personal opinion and experience of online courses for Data Science, I have also taken into consideration the quality of the institutions, the syllabus and the quality/price (not in order):

* [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) by UDEMY: it covers all the basics for Machine Learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Languege Processing, Deep Learning & Model Selection -> Cost: ~15€ (during weekly sales)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by COURSERA & STANFORD: it provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition -> Cost: free
* [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) by COURSERA & IBM: the program consists of 9 online courses that will provide you with job-ready tools and skills, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You’ll learn through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets -> Cost: 32€/month
* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science?) by COURSERA & JOHNS HOPKINS: the program covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results.
